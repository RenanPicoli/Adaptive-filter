# Adaptive-filter
My first tests developing adaptive filtering in GNU Octave

Only run 'adaptive_filter' in GNU-Octave or Matlab,
this example uses adaptive filtering to guess what "unknown" filter u was applied on a sinusoidal signal.

Next step is to prevent "zigzagging" around the answer by adapting the constant for gradient descent method.
